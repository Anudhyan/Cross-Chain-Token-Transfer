# Cross-Chain Token Transfer

## Overview

Cross-Chain Token Transfer is a project designed to facilitate the seamless transfer of tokens between two blockchain networks. This project leverages Wormhole technology to enable interoperability between the **PolygonAmoyToken** and **PolygonCardonaToken** across distinct blockchain networks, ensuring secure and efficient token movement. This project aims to address the challenge of cross-chain asset transfers by providing a reliable mechanism for decentralized applications to interact with multiple chains.

## Integration with Wormhole Technology

Wormhole is used as the cross-chain bridge protocol in this project. It enables communication and token transfers between the different blockchain networks by securely bridging the gap between the **Polygon** tokens deployed on different chains. Wormhole handles the process of locking tokens on one chain and minting them on another, ensuring that the asset is correctly reflected across chains without duplication.

By integrating Wormhole, the project guarantees that cross-chain transfers are secure, efficient, and fully decentralized.

## Features

- **Cross-Chain Token Transfer:** Allows users to transfer tokens between different blockchain networks without needing centralized exchanges.
- **Secure Transactions:** Ensures the integrity and security of token transfers through the Wormhole protocol.
- **Decentralized Bridge:** The Wormhole integration provides a trustless and decentralized solution for token migration across multiple chains.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed.
- A MetaMask wallet configured for Polygon.
- A Wormhole account for bridging tokens across chains.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anudhyan/Cross-Chain-Token-Transfer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Cross-Chain-Token-Transfer
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   - Configure the environment variables for the project by creating a `.env` file in the root directory. The `.env` file should contain the following:
     ```
     POLYGON_RPC_URL=<Your Polygon RPC URL>
     PRIVATE_KEY=<Your Wallet Private Key>
     WORMHOLE_API_KEY=<Your Wormhole API Key>
     ```

5. **Deploy Contracts:**
   - Deploy the contracts for **PolygonAmoyToken** and **PolygonCardonaToken** on the respective chains using Hardhat:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
   ```

6. **Initiate Cross-Chain Transfer:**
   - Use the provided scripts or interface to trigger the cross-chain token transfer via the Wormhole bridge.

## Usage

1. **Transfer Tokens:**
   - Select the source and destination chains, and specify the number of tokens to transfer.
   
2. **Monitor the Transfer:**
   - Track the status of the transaction using the Wormhole network explorer.

3. **Confirm Receipt:**
   - Once the tokens are transferred, confirm receipt on the destination chain.

## Project Structure

- `contracts/`: Contains the Solidity contracts for token implementation.
- `scripts/`: Deployment and cross-chain transfer scripts.
- `test/`: Unit tests for the smart contracts.
- `frontend/`: A basic UI for interacting with the project (if applicable).
